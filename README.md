# Build
requires:

c++ compilter with c++23 \
SFML dev lib \
[Argparse](https://github.com/p-ranav/argparse)Â \
A chess engine like [StockFish](https://github.com/official-stockfish/Stockfish/releases/latest) \

# Tests
### Requirements

requires:
python3
[chess python package](https://python-chess.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

The chess python package is just for checking if the GUI legal moves match
I tried to use the `go perft 1` from stockfish but it was quite a bit slower

### Test database sources
[4000_openings_legacy.epd and new2500.epd](https://github.com/MichaelB7/Crafty/)
